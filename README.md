From the OECD site about the data:

> The [International Trade (MEI)] dataset is a subset of the [Main Economic Indicators] (MEI) database which contains predominantly monthly statistics, and associated statistical methodological information, for the 34 OECD member countries and for some non-member countries: Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Russian Federation, and South Africa. The MEI database contains a wide variety statistics that can be classified as Short-Term Economic Statistics. 
>
> The [International Trade (MEI)] dataset itself contains international trade statistics measured in billions of United States dollars (USD) for: Exports, Imports, Balance, and World Trade statistics. In all cases a lot of effort has been made to ensure that the data are internationally comparable across all countries presented and that all the subjects have good historical time-seriesâ€™ data to aid with analysis.
